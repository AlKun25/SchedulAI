# Agile Product Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the AI-powered task scheduling app, using 2-week sprints and GitHub Projects for project management.

## Sprint Cadence

- Each sprint is 2 weeks long
- Sprint Planning on the first Monday of each sprint
- Sprint Review and Retrospective on the last Friday of each sprint

## GitHub Projects Setup

- Use GitHub Projects for managing the product backlog and sprint backlogs
- Create the following columns in the project board:
  1. Backlog
  2. Sprint Backlog
  3. In Progress
  4. Review
  5. Done

## Ongoing Activities (Across All Sprints)

- Regular backlog grooming and prioritization
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) improvements
- Code reviews and adherence to coding standards
- User feedback collection and analysis
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Security audits and updates

## GitHub Projects Workflow

1. At the start of each sprint, move items from the Backlog to the Sprint Backlog
2. During the sprint, move items through In Progress and Review columns
3. At the end of the sprint, ensure all completed items are in the Done column
4. Use GitHub Issues for individual tasks and link them to the project board
5. Utilize GitHub's automation features to move issues between columns based on their status

## Key Milestones

- End of Sprint 4: MVP Release
- End of Sprint 8: Enhanced Version Release
- End of Sprint 12: Public Release

This Agile Product Roadmap provides a high-level overview of the development plan for your AI-powered task scheduling app. It's designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments based on user feedback, technical challenges, and changing priorities. Regular reviews and updates to this roadmap will ensure it remains aligned with your project goals and market demands.
