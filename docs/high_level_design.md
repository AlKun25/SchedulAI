# High-Level Design Document (Updated)

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Microservices Architecture

The system will be built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Key microservices include:

1. User Service
2. Task Service
3. Scheduling Service
4. Calendar Integration Service
5. AI/ML Service
6. Notification Service

### 1.2 Load Balancing

To handle 1 million users:

- Implement a Layer 7 load balancer (e.g., NGINX or HAProxy)
- Use round-robin algorithm for even distribution
- Implement health checks for backend services

### 1.3 Caching

- Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Use CDN for static assets

### 1.4 Database

- Primary database: PostgreSQL for structured data
- Secondary database: MongoDB for unstructured data (e.g., user preferences)

### 1.5 Message Queue

- RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between services

## 2. API Design

### 2.1 RESTful API

- Use REST architecture for API design
- Implement versioning (e.g., /api/v1/)

### 2.2 Key Endpoints

- `/api/v1/users`: User management
- `/api/v1/tasks`: Task CRUD operations
- `/api/v1/schedule`: Scheduling operations
- `/api/v1/calendar`: Calendar integration
- `/api/v1/ai`: AI-related operations (e.g., image processing)
- `/api/v1/images`: Image upload and processing operations

### 2.3 Authentication

- Use JWT for API authentication
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for Google Calendar integration

## 3. Database Design

### 3.1 PostgreSQL Schema

- Users Table
- Tasks Table
- Schedules Table
- Categories Table
- Tags Table

### 3.2 MongoDB Collections

- UserPreferences
- AIModels
- Analytics

## 4. AI/ML Component

### 4.1 LLM Integration

- Use OpenAI's GPT API for natural language processing
- Implement fine-tuning for task scheduling optimization

### 4.2 Image Processing

- Utilize Google Cloud Vision API for initial image analysis and text extraction
- Implement custom ML model for categorizing images based on content and user annotations
- Integrate natural language processing for interpreting user captions and slash commands

## 5. Frontend Architecture

### 5.1 Vue.js Framework

- Use Vue.js for building the user interface
- Implement Vuex for state management
- Use Vue Router for client-side routing

### 5.2 Component Structure

- Create reusable Vue components for common UI elements
- Implement a modular structure for easy maintenance and scalability

### 5.3 Responsive Design

- Use Vue's responsive design capabilities for mobile and desktop compatibility
- Implement CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development

## 6. Scalability Considerations

### 6.1 Horizontal Scaling

- Design services to be stateless for easy scaling
- Use Kubernetes for container orchestration

### 6.2 Database Scaling

- Implement database sharding for PostgreSQL
- Use replica sets for MongoDB

## 7. Security Measures

### 7.1 Data Encryption

- Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

### 7.2 Authentication and Authorization

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

### 8.1 Monitoring

- Implement Prometheus for metrics collection
- Use Grafana for visualization

### 8.2 Logging

- Centralized logging using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## 9. Deployment and DevOps

### 9.1 Containerization

- Use Docker for containerizing microservices
- Implement Docker Compose for local development environments

### 9.2 CI/CD

- Use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- Implement automated testing in the CI pipeline

### 9.3 Environment Management

- Set up separate development, staging, and production environments
- Use environment variables for configuration management

This high-level design provides a foundation for building a scalable, performant, and maintainable AI-powered task scheduling application using Vue.js as the frontend framework.
